Administrame is a web-app that will allow the Mercdo Libre sellers. We want to provide automated responses to their clients, like how much the shipping will cost to an specific Zipcode, questions about stock, from size and color to huge or small units.

In this project, our intention is to use the ruby-sdk of mercadolibre.

The installation was straight forward to the c9 project.

The instanciation was made in the Controller, de definition of the keys were there too. 

This was kind of learning the basic use of an API.
